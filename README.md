Winner of the Elastic Team Flutter Coding Challenge - Activity Tracker App!

The Elastic Team Flutter Coding Challenge was a challenge designed to assess a participant's ability to build a user-friendly activity tracker app using Flutter and Dart. It required the participants to develop a Flutter application that retrieves and displays activities from the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) and allows users to edit, and delete activities. The app needed to be compatible with Android, iOS, and web platforms, and use any state management method or library of the participant's choice.
